# Traffic Light Controller using FSM (Verilog)

This project implements a traffic light controller using Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog HDL.

## Description
The controller cycles through RED, GREEN, and YELLOW states based on clock edges. Reset forces the system into the RED state. The design has been verified through simulation.

## Features
- FSM-based design
- Clear state transitions
- Clock and reset supported
- Waveform verified

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / Vivado

## Files
- traffic_light.v       -> Main module
- traffic_light_tb.v    -> Testbench
